### Welcome to Ecoforecast Africa!

This is the African chapter of the [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](https://ecoforecast.org/).

Our mission is to build a community of practice around near-term iterative ecological forecasting in Africa, aiming at improving our fundamental understanding of African ecosystems and translating that knowledge into tools to assist their management and conservation.

Please [**JOIN US**](join.qmd) to receive updates on our activities and events.
